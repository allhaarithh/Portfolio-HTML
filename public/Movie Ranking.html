<h1>The Best Movies According to Alhaarith</h1>

<h2>Top 3 Movies of all time in my perspective(*Not in Order)</h2>

<h3>Interstellar</h3>
    <p>Interstellar is a movie like no other. Unlike many apocalyptic sci-fi films that feature advanced technology as the source of our destruction (ala The Terminator movies), it instead asserts that technology will save us.

    Not everyone in Interstellar recognizes the potential of advanced technology. Most dismiss it as a waste of time and resources, and not just old curmudgeons feel this way. Thoughtful, intelligent young characters share this sentiment. This belief gained steam following a world-wide blight that wiped out the vast majority of life on earthâ€”crops and humans.
    
    Farming became paramount while advanced technology was deemed frivolous. Cooper (McConaughey) remains one of the few survivors who still appreciates the need for engineering. He feels like a man lost in time, until he stumbles into the headquarters of NASA (which had been operating in secret due to public disapproval). Here he meets others who realize that a return to our old ways is unsustainable and will ultimately lead to our demise. We need technology to save us. As Michael Caine, playing the brilliant (duh!) Professor Brand, eloquently tells Cooper, "we were never meant to save the world. We were meant to leave it." For a movie that won an Oscar for Best Visual Effects (and deservedly so) the sound stole the show. Hans Zimmer (Dark Knight Trilogy) unleashed a performance that was, quite appropriately, out of this world. Never have I seen a movie elevated so much by its score. The sound literally took my breath away. Forgive me for the next paragraph. I will gush irresponsibly about the magic that is this movie's sound. Skip it if you please. You have your warning.
    
    The music fueled every important scene. In every meaningful moment Zimmer's harmonies captivated watchers' attention in the way of a coach commanding a locker room with a pregame speech. The music elucidated those emotional scenes, particularly ones featuring Cooper and his daughter, in a way that no words or visual ques possibly could. I sat frozen, jaw agape, with tears pouring down my cheeks as the music completely overwhelmed my emotions. The sound penetrated my soul and reverberated through my body, flowing to my appendages, supplying me with life like a heartbeat pumping blood through my veins. The music was truly the life force of movie.
    
    Yes, we all witnessed a visual triumph, a daring creative wonder the likes of which we haven't encountered since Inception. Yes, nearly every actor's performance proved worthy of commendation. McConaughey is on fire. Chastain is blossoming into a star. At this point Michael Cain exudes such knowledge and wisdom by merely appearing on screen that if he were cast as Albert Einstein, people would wonder if the role were beneath him. All this considered, and the sound still towered over everything.
    
    I walked out of the theater believing that I had experienced something unique, something truly special. Interstellar inspires, it awes, and above all it entertains. I cannot ask for more than that.</p>

<h3>The Imitation Game</h3>
    <p>Alan Turing was a fascinating, complex person who deserves to be better known to the world. Likewise his story is important and deserves to be told rather than forgotten. Had high hopes for 'The Imitation Game', after hearing so many good things about it, and it ended up being one of my favourite films of 2014.

    That 'The Imitation Game' is historically inaccurate and has distortions didn't offend me as much as some reviewers, biographical dramas are notorious for this so it's come to be expected by me (not that that is meant to be an excuse). All that was wanted was a film that made me think, moved me, was well made and well acted. 'The Imitation Game' was all those things and more.
    
    It isn't perfect, the political elements are on the preachy side and there are a few strands that could have gone into more detail, Turing's sexuality should have gotten into more depth than it was.
    
    However, 'The Imitation Game' is exceptionally well made. It's immaculately photographed and has some of the best production design of its best, especially in the costumes. The direction allows the film to be absorbing, while the music score is often hauntingly beautiful and never intrusive.
    
    In terms of the script, 'The Imitation Game' does a wonderful job in provoking thought and providing emotional impact and nuances and fleshes the characters out with remarkable complexity. What could have been potentially dry treatment of the subject matter turned out to be fascinating, thrilling and very moving.
    
    Benedict Cumberbatch gives his best performance of a very solid career, an outstanding portrayal that won't be forgotten for years to come. Keira Knightley is a sympathetic confidante and Charles Dance is excellent as always as his superior. The supporting cast are without complaint.
    
    Overall, wonderful film and its acclaim is a long way from an enigma.</p>

<h3>A Silent Voice</h3>
    <p>A Silent Voice (or "The Shape of a Voice") is a great addition to the "slice of life" anime of modern times. At times life affirming in its quieter moments, at other times shocking in its depiction of Japanese teen life.

    Egged on by his school mates, Shoya bullies the newly arrived Shoko, who happens to be deaf. Perceived to be receiving special treatment, and being different (a crime in Japanese society), Shoko is fair game for any number of cruelties. Until it goes too far.
    
    This movie then takes a different approach. Instead of showing the bullied person's return to strength, it shows the traumatised bully (and his cohorts) as he seeks to recover from the horror he put Shoko through. You may balk at the thought, but the paths of Shoya and Shoko are explored in their later high school lives, both being treated sympathetically.
    
    The animation is beautiful, the script manages to avoid typical Japanese cliche, and the story takes some shocking turns without relying on trite misery or emotional manipulation. If you miss Ghibli, give this a watch. You'll be happy to know the spirit of great Japanese animation lives on.</p>
